\begin{abstract}

The relaxation times of heavy mineral oil are experimentally determined in this study. The nuclei of heavy mineral oil investigated are very abundant and give particularly strong signals.
The spin-lattice relaxation time is (24.5$\pm$0.9)\,ms and the spin-spin relaxation time is (18.2$\pm$1.5)\,ms.

%The sigma deviations of LiF ranged between 0.77$\sigma$ to 1.94$\sigma$. The low sigma results showed that the lithium fluoride quite accurately determined the lattice constant. Conversely, the sodium chloride sigma errors ranged between 2.27$\sigma$ to 3.28$\sigma$, which showed more deviation, but was still acceptable.

\section{Background and Theory}
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\,(NMR) spectroscopy was first utilized in 1946. The NMR technique is useful for studying physical phenomena from kinetics to superconductivity, and was recognized with a Nobel Prize in Physics\,\cite{1}. The major importance of NMR is the ability to characterize materials by probing the nuclei and immediate surroundings. Within a certain solid there are varieties of local magnetic fields, and NMR spectroscopy is able to measure the local field at atomic nuclei. NMR also has implications in the medical field, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging\,(MRI). The imaging technique allows physicians to produce noninvasive three dimensional images of blood flow patterns in both the brain and heart, and eventually hopes to pinpoint malignant tissue without biopsies\,\cite{2}.
\\
\indent Magnetic Resonance\,(MR) is observed in constituents that have both a magnetic moment\,($\mu$) and angular momentum\,(J). It's imperative to note that many, but not all, of the stable nuclei exhibit these traits. 
%Simply, the observed nuclei both have spin one-half, therefore each magnetization step will displace nuclei by 90\degree. The displacements are illustrated in figure\,\ref{magnet} for the 90\degree and 180\degree pulses.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\vfill\eject
The two magnetization states that are concerned in this study include the T$_1$ and the T$_2$ states. The initial magnetization is in the positive z-direction.
\begin{equation}
M_0=M_z
\end{equation}

T$_1$ is called the spin-lattice constant relaxation time, which requires a two pulse sequence. An initial 180\degree pulse flips the magnetization from M$_z$ to -M$_z$. The 180\degree pulse is followed by a 90\degree B pulse, which coverts the -M$_z$ state into the M$_{xy}$ plane-magnetization.
\\
\indent The T$_2$ state is called the spin-spin relaxation time. As the magnetization reaches the -M$_z$ state, the spin echo is triggered and an exponential decay is seen as time propagates. An initial 90\degree pulse turns M$_z$ to the M$_{xy}$ plane-magnetization. Following the initiation pulse, a secondary 180\degree pulse then changes the magnetization plane from M$_{xy}$ to -M$_{xy}$. Initial magnetization re-phases through the spin echo, and the time decay for this phenomena was measured as exponential decay.

\section{Apparatus}
The study used an apparatus, which a schematic is shown in figure\,\ref{scheme}, consisting mainly of a permanent magnet connected to a mainframe. The mainframe allowed for the manipulation of the A-pulse length\,(A\_len), B-pulse length\,(B\_len), tau\,($\tau$), iterations\,(Num\_B), period\,(P), and start pulse. A PS2 controller was connected to the mainframe to render various gradient configurations of the magnetic field. Voltage amplitudes were generated on the oscilloscope for data of relaxation calculations.

\section{Procedure and Relevant Equations}

The sample used in this study was Heavy Mineral Oil\,(HIO). Initially, the NMR needed to be calibrated. Calibration was done using the Radio Frequency\,(RF) probe, and measuring the voltage outputs. HIO was prepared and placed into the magnetic field of the permanent magnet. A single pulse sequence consists of two bursts of RF magnetic field separated by a variable time, $\tau$. T1 was found by, an initial 180\degree pulse, followed by a 90\degree pulse. This two sequence procedure was iterated with varying times, $\tau$, between the A and B pulses. T2 was found by a pulse sequence of 90\degree to 180\degree\ to the echo maximum for a total time, 2$\tau$.



\begin{equation}
M_z =M_0(1-2e^{-\frac{t}{T_1}})
\label{t1eqn}
\end{equation}

The magnetization does not appear instantly, as there is a delay time between 90\degree and 180\degree pulses, so the observed quantities will portray an exponential growth, represented in equation\,\ref{t1eqn}. The instantaneous value, M, in equation\,\ref{t1eqn} represents the magnetization, while M$_0$ is the equilibrium value\,\cite{2}.

\begin{equation}
M_{xy}=M_0e^{\frac{-2t}{T_2}}
\label{t2eqn}
\end{equation}

Secondly, the T$_2$ state is the second degree magnetization. The exponential decay is represented in equation\,\ref{t2eqn}. The coefficient, 2, describes the progression from the 0\degree to 180\degree\,($\tau$) and from the 180\degree to spin echo\,(2$\tau$) state.




\section{Calculation of Results and Errors}
Figure\,\ref{T1unfig} was the original data that included the maximum amplitude of the Fee Induction Decay. To achieve the generated fit, the amplitudes before the minimum were flipped to negative amplitudes, resulting in figure\,\ref{T1fig}. The fits in equations\,\ref{t1eqn} and \ref{t2eqn} yielded computed results of the relaxation times. T$_1$ and T$_2$ were determined to be (24.5$\pm$0.9)\,ms and (18.2$\pm$1.5)\,ms, respectively.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The spin-lattice constant relaxation time was found to be (24.5$\pm$0.9)\,ms. Additionally, the spin-spin relaxation time was determined to be (18.2$\pm$1.5)\,ms. There were no literature values for these decay times, therefore sigma deviations were not reported. Error was mainly resultant from the oscilloscope while reading voltages. The maximum jump observed was 0.45\,V, therefore that uncertainty was carried for each value. An analysis was conducted on a fluorine sample, but due to low resolution in data, this sample was nullified.
