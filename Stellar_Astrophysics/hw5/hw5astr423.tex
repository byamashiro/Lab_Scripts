%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.x LaTeX 2e macros.

%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.
%%
%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.

%% AASTeX 6.0 supports the ability to suppress the names and affiliations
%% of some authors and displaying them under a "collaboration" banner to
%% minimize the amount of author information that to be printed.  This 
%% should be reserved for articles with an extreme number of authors.
%%
%% Mark up commands to limit the number of authors on the front page.
\AuthorCallLimit=2
%% Will only show Schwarz & Muench since Schwarz and Muench
%% are in the same \author call. 
\fullcollaborationName{The Friends of AASTeX Collaboration}
%% will print the collaboration text after the shortened author list.
%% These commands have to COME BEFORE the \author calls.
%%
%% Note that all of these author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable.
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.

%% This is the end of the preamble.  Indicate the beginning of the

\begin{document}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than

%% you desire.

\title{HW 05: Protostars}

%% Use \author, \affil, plus the \and command to format author and affiliation 
%% information.  If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.
%%
%% The \affil should be used to document primary affiliations and the
%% \altaffil should be used for secondary affiliations, titles, or email.

%% Authors with the same affiliation can be grouped in a single
%% \author and \affil call.
\author{Bryan Yamashiro\altaffilmark{1}}
\affil{University of Hawaii at Manoa \\
2500 Campus Road \\
Honolulu, HI 96822}


%% Use the \and command so offset the last author.

%% Notice that each of these authors has alternate affiliations, which
%% are identified by the \altaffilmark after each name.  Specify alternate
%% affiliation information with \altaffiltext, with one command per each
%% affiliation.

%\altaffiltext{1}{A cool dude}
%\altaffiltext{2}{Another cool dude}


%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. 

\section{Initial Phase of Protostar Evolution}
\subsection{Method 1}
The relation used to calculate the radius of a protostar\,(R$_{ps}$) is provided in equation\,\ref{proto}. Only the species of H and H$_2$ are probed, therefore higher order additions including species such as Helium are omitted. The individual stellar parameters used to calculate R$_{ps}$ are provided in table\,\ref{parameters}. The equation was rewritten in equation\,\ref{derived} to yield R$_{ps}$. Plugging in the parameters from the table resulted in a protostar radius of \st{$\boxed{7.1854\times10^{11}\,m}$} or approximately \st{$\boxed{1033\,R_\odot}$}.



\begin{equation}
GM\left(\frac{1}{R_{ps}}-\frac{1}{R_1}\right)\approx \frac{1}{m_H}\left(\frac{\epsilon_d}{2} + \epsilon_i\right)+R_2
\label{proto}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R_{ps} = m_H G M \left(\frac{2}{\epsilon_d} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_i}\right)
\label{derived}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Method 2}
The second attempt to find the protostar radius purely utilizes the gravitational energy in equation\,\ref{rad2}. The total of dissociation and ionization energy, E$_{total}$ was found using equation\,\ref{energy}, and the result was 3.0199$\times$10$^{46}$\,erg. E$_{total}$ in this case corresponds to the gravitational potential energy, -2U$_{total}$. The resulting radius of the protostar using method 2 was $\boxed{8.7436\times10^{10}\,m}$ or $\boxed{125.72\,R_\odot}$. If the density is uniform a 3/5 approximation can be applied for the gravitational potential energy, and multiplying the factor to the radii, results in a protostar radius of $\boxed{75.43\,R_\odot}$.

\begin{equation}
E_{total} = \frac{M}{2m_H} \epsilon_d + \frac{M}{m_H} \epsilon_i
\label{energy}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R = \left|\frac{G M}{E_{total}}\right|
\label{rad2}

\section{Reaching Quasi-Hydrostatic Equilibrium}

To calculate the average internal temperature\,($\bar{T}$), the Viral theorem is invoked in equation\,\ref{temp}. It is imperative to note that since we are concerned with ionized hydrogen, $\mu$ is 1/2, therefore the denominator would be 6 for this case. In this instance, $\bar{T}$ is dependent on the protostar mass\,(M) in the numerator. The resulting average internal temperature is \st{$\boxed{7460.66\,K}$}. Using the radius from method 2, the average internal temperature of the protostar was $\boxed{6.131\times10^{4}\,K}$.

%\begin{equation}
%\bar{T} = \frac{\mu m_H G M}{3 k_B R_{ps}}
%\label{temp}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\bar{T} = \frac{\mu m_H G M}{3 k_B R_{ps}}
\label{temp}
\end{equation}








%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc.


%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% \aastex provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.
